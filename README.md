# Hive Monitoring System (work in progress)


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Welcome to the **Hive Monitoring System repository**!

This project contains the end-to-end code for a hand-made hive monitoring system powered by **Arduino**, designed to 
help beekeepers to keep track of the health and productivity of their hives. 
The system includes hardware for sensing various hive metrics (such as temperature, humidity, and hive weight), as well as software for visualizing and analyzing the data collected by the sensors.

The code in this repository is organized into several folders:

- **hardware**: Contains the design files and firmware for the sensor hardware
- **server**: contains the code for the **server-side component** of the system, including the code for storing and retrieving data from the database
- **client**: contains the code for the client-side component of the system, including the code for visualizing the data and providing analysis tools
To get started with the project, you will need to assemble the hardware and install the firmware. Once that is done, you can set up the server and client components of the system on your computer or a remote server.

We hope you find this project useful, and we welcome any contributions or feedback you may have!
